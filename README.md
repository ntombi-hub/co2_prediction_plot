CO2 Emissions Prediction for SDG 13 (Climate Action)
Project Overview
This project addresses UN Sustainable Development Goal 13 (Climate Action) by using a machine learning model to predict CO₂ emissions based on features like GDP, population, and energy use. The goal is to identify key drivers of emissions to support policymakers in designing sustainable interventions.

Objective: Predict CO₂ emissions using supervised learning (linear regression).
Dataset: Simplified CO₂ emissions data (sample provided; can use datasets from Kaggle or World Bank).
Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Visual Studio Code.
Output:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to evaluate model performance.
Visualization of predicted vs. actual emissions.
Model coefficients to interpret feature importance.
